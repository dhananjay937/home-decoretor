<h1>TIPS</h1>
<ol type="1">
	<li>Always have a complete plan</li>
	<p>Tip: A complete plan of what you want helps you to organize schedules for every phase of your
design thereby avoiding conflicts of execution and misplacement.</p>
    <li> A complete floor plan is always a very good start</li>
    <p>Tip: A floor plan allows you to know if your furniture is sized properly and you will know precisely that space will not be overly crowded. Designers provide you a good floor plan that adjusts to your needs so that way you can achieve your project with confidence by doing the right thing.

    <li>Right choice of colors is very crucial.</li>
    <p>Tip: Just liking a color is not always the right start. Colors tend to bring your mood up or down depending on the individual and a combination of colors can be very tricky. A professional advice can help you in creating the right ambiance and mood.</p>
    <li>Styles change.</li>
    <p>Tip: Styles are not only what is in the ambiance, it is the structure as well and a very important part of the project in making sure you are keeping it in harmony with your main structure.</p>
    <li>Art.</li>
    <p>Tip: Though art is a very personal thing, having a professional advice of the art you are getting could be a nice addition to your project. A good piece of art will constantly cheer your spirit. Once your ideal piece of art has been chosen, all you need is to make sure it has been placed correctly, has been well lit and dimensioned properly in the right ambiance.</p>
    <li> Selection of ambiance is an important decision.</li>
    <p>Tip: What goes where is definitely a must know before everything starts. A good design always has a good distribution of lighting including mood lighting, strategic placement of electrical outlets is essential as well as telephone lines for computers & extra telephones, sound distribution, etc. is one of the priorities because it usually needs to be done before finishing. All these details lead us towards getting the desired ambiance.</p>
    <li> Accessories.</li>
    <p>Tip: Accessories are vital in interiors as they enhance your design and decor. Having a good selection of accessories is almost as important as the entire project itself. It will be your final touch and it needs to be the right touch! So always go slow with each piece so that way youâ€™ll avoid extra expenses and your project will end successfully.</p>
